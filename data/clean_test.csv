There is no way for buyers to make a dispute once the max shipment days have reached. Especially for shipments through normal mail and no tracking is available. I am one such buyer who got scammed. Latest update: shoppee has helped me to get back my money from the fraud seller. I am pleased that shoppee had listened and help to investigate the matter to make this app a better platform for shopping.
